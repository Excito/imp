The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet
Messaging Program (IMP) version H3 (4.3.10).

IMP, the Internet Messaging Program, is one of the most popular webmail
applications available.  It allows universal, web-based access to IMAP and
POP3 mail servers and provides a full range of features normally found only in
desktop email clients.

The major changes compared to IMP version H3 (4.3.9) are:
    * Fixed a minor bug in the iTip attachment viewer.
    * Updated Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Hungarian, and Russian translations.
